## Build, run and debug the sample code
### Prerequisites

To run the completed project in this folder, you need the following:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your development machine. (**Note:** This tutorial was written with Node version 16.14.0. The steps in this guide may work with other versions, but that has not been tested.)
- Either a personal Microsoft account with a mailbox on Outlook.com, or a Microsoft work or school account. You can [sign up for the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) to get a free Microsoft 365 subscription.

### Manually run on your local machine
#### 1. Run command below to clone the repo and install the project dependency
```
git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Excel-Scenario-based-Add-in-Samples.git && cd Excel-Scenario-based-Add-in-Samples/Mail-Merge-Sample-Add-in && npm install
```
#### 2. Open the `Excel-Scenario-based-Add-in-Samples/Mail-Merge-Sample-Add-in` folder in Visual Studio Code.You can see the sample code and make code changes to the sample.

#### 3. If you have an application ID already, please ensure: 

In [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) under **Identity > Applications > App registrations**: 
- Navigate to **Redirect URI**, set the first drop-down to `Single-page application (SPA)` and its value to `https://localhost:3000/consent.html`.

Otherwise, if you haven't registered a web application with the Azure Active Directory admin center, please follow the steps below:
* Log into [Microsoft Entra admin center](
https://aad.portal.azure.com) using a personal or business Microsoft account.
* In the navigation, select **Identity > Applications > App registrations**.
* Choose **New registration**. On the **App registrations** page, configure the values as follows: 
    - Set **Name** to `Office Add-in Graph Tutorial`.
    - Set **Supported account types** to **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**.
    - Under **Redirect URI**, set the first drop-down to `Single-page application (SPA)` and set the value to `
https://localhost:3000/consent.html`.
* Click **Register** and copy the value of the **Application (client) ID**.

#### 4. In Visual Studio Code: edit the `taskpane.js` file and replace `YOUR_APP_ID_HERE` with the **Application Id** you got from the App Registration Portal. 

#### 5. Run the following command in your CLI to start the sample add-in on desktop.
```
npm run start
```

### Expected result

A webpack server will be hosted on https://localhost:3000/, as the CLI shows:
