## Build, run and debug the sample code
### Prerequisites

To run the completed project in this folder, you need the following:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your development machine. (**Note:** This tutorial was written with Node version 16.14.0. The steps in this guide may work with other versions, but that has not been tested.)
- Either a personal Microsoft account with a mailbox on Outlook.com, or a Microsoft work or school account. You can [sign up for the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) to get a free Microsoft 365 subscription.

### Manually run on your local machine
#### 1. Run command below to clone the repo and install the project dependency
```console
git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Excel-Scenario-based-Add-in-Samples.git && cd Excel-Scenario-based-Add-in-Samples/Mail-Merge-Sample-Add-in && npm install
```
#### 2. Open the `Excel-Scenario-based-Add-in-Samples/Mail-Merge-Sample-Add-in` folder in Visual Studio Code.You can see the sample code and make code changes to the sample.

#### 3. If you have an application ID already, please ensure: 
    
In [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) under **Identity > Applications > App registrations**: 
- Navigate to **Redirect URI**, set the first drop-down to `Single-page application (SPA)` and its value to `https://localhost:3000/consent.html`.

Otherwise, if you haven't registered a web application with the Azure Active Directory admin center, please follow the steps below:
* Log into [Microsoft Entra admin center](
https://aad.portal.azure.com) using a personal or business Microsoft account.
* In the navigation, select **Identity > Applications > App registrations**.
* Choose **New registration**. On the **App registrations** page, configure the values as follows: 
    - Set **Name** to `Office Add-in Graph Tutorial`.
    - Set **Supported account types** to **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**.
    - Under **Redirect URI**, set the first drop-down to `Single-page application (SPA)` and set the value to `
https://localhost:3000/consent.html`.
* Click **Register** and copy the value of the **Application (client) ID**.

#### 4. In Visual Studio Code: edit the `taskpane.js` file and replace `YOUR_APP_ID_HERE` with the **Application Id** you got from the App Registration Portal. 

#### 5. Run the following command in your CLI to start the sample add-in on desktop.
```console
npm run start
```

### Expected result

A webpack server will be hosted on https://localhost:3000/, as the CLI shows:

![](./assets/webpack.png)

An Excel desktop application will be auto-launched and the Mail Merge Addin will be auto-run on the right taskpane area. The sideload steps has been integrated into the process, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

Please follow the steps below:

1. Create Sample Data, including valid email address (required) and other information.

2. Verify Template and Data, the To Line must contain the column name of the email address.

3. Send Email, which will pop up a dialog to get the consent of Microsoft Graph. After sign-in, the email will be send out.

### Sideload the sample add-in on Excel Online

The previous steps show you how to run our sample on Desktop. As for the Excel Online, please follow the following steps to sideload the manifest.xml file on web.

1.  **Keep the webpack server on** to host your sample add-in.
1.  Open [Office on the web](https://office.live.com/).
1.  Choose **Excel**, and then open a new document.
1.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Add-ins** section, choose **Add-ins** and click **More Add-ins** on the lower-right corner to open Add-in Store Page.
1.  On the **Office Add-ins** dialog, select the **MY ADD-INS** tab, choose **Manage My Add-ins**, and then **Upload My Add-in**.
