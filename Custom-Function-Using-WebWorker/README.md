### Run the add-in using Office Add-in Dev Kit
[Office Add-in Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msoffice.microsoft-office-add-in-debugger) is an end-to end developer tool for building Office add-ins. You can use this tool to easily creating, running and debugging, and managing the lifecycle of an Office add-in.
<br><img src="./assets/devkit_preview.png" width="800"/>

1. **Check and Install Dependencies**

    Select `Check and Install Dependencies` to check your environment and install necessary dependencies in order to run and debug the add-in code.

3. **Preview Your Office Add-in (F5)**
    
    Select `Preview Your Office Add-in(F5)` on the side panel to start running and debugging the add-in code. A Word/Excel/PowerPoint app will launch with the add-in sample side-loaded.
    * To debug on Office on the web, go to [Sideload Office Add-ins to Office on the web](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing)
    * To debug in Desktop (Edge Legacy), go to [Debug Edge Legacy Webview](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/debug-add-ins-using-devtools-edge-legacy)
    
    **If you meet sideload errors, please first confirm the following items and check [troubleshoot development errors]( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/troubleshoot-development-errors) for common issues. If you still have problems, [Create an issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js/issues/new/choose) and we'll help you out.** 
    
    * You have installed dependencies.
    * You have closed all Word/Excel/PowerPoint apps.
    * You have stopped your last add-in previewing session.

4. **Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in**

    Select `Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in` to stop debugging.

### How to use this sample

After launch Excel with add-in sample side-loaded, follow below steps:
1. Click the executeCFWithoutWebWorker button, a CustomFunction without WebWorker will be instered into the 'A1' Cell and executed, and the ball inside the taskpane will be blocked.
2. Click the executeCFWithWebWorker button, a CustomFunction with WebWorker will be instered into the 'A1' Cell and executed, and the ball inside the taskpane will not be blocked.

Now you can use the following custom functions:

```
=WebWorkerSample.TEST(2)
=WebWorkerSample.TEST_PROMISE(2)
=WebWorkerSample.TEST_ERROR(2)
=WebWorkerSample.TEST_ERROR_PROMISE(2)
=WebWorkerSample.TEST_UI_THREAD(2)
```

If you open the task pane you will see an animated bouncing ball. You can see the effect of blocking the UI thread by entering `=WebWorkerSample.TEST_UI_THREAD(50000)` into a cell. The bouncing ball will stop for a few seconds while the result is calculated.

### Dispatch to web worker

When a custom function needs to use a web worker, we turn the calculation into a job and dispatch it to a web worker. The **dispatchCalculationJob** function takes the function name and parameters from a custom function, and creates a job object that is posted to a web worker. For more details see the **dispatchCalculationJob** function in [functions.js](functions.js).

```JavaScript
    // Post a job to the web worker to do the calculation
    function dispatchCalculationJob(functionName, parameters) {
        const jobId = g_nextJobId++;
        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
            // store the promise information.
            g_jobIdToPromiseInfoMap[jobId] = {resolve: resolve, reject: reject};
            const worker = getOrCreateWebWorker(jobId);
            worker.postMessage({
                jobId: jobId,
                name: functionName,
                parameters: parameters
            });
        });
    }
```

### Web worker runs the job and returns the result

The web worker runs the job specified in the job object to do the actual calculation. The web worker code is in a separate file in [functions-worker.js](functions-worker.js).

The functions-worker.js will:

1. Receive a message containing the job to run.
1. Invoke a function to perform the calculation.
1. Call **postMessage** to post the result back to the main thread.

```JavaScript
self.addEventListener('message',
    function(event) {
        let data = event.data;
        if (typeof(data) == "string") {
            data = JSON.parse(data);
        }

        const jobId = data.jobId;
        try {
            const result = invokeFunction(data.name, data.parameters);
            // check whether the result is a promise
            if (typeof(result) == "function" || typeof(result) == "object" && typeof(result.then) == "function") {
                result.then(function(realResult) {
                    postMessage(
                        {
                            jobId: jobId,
                            result: realResult
                        }
                    );
                })
                .catch(function(ex) {
                    postMessage(
                        {
                            jobId: jobId,
                            error: true
                        }
                    )
                });
            }
            else {
                postMessage({
                    jobId: jobId,
                    result: result
                });
            }
        }
        catch(ex) {
            postMessage({
                jobId: jobId,
                error: true
            });
        }
    }
);

```

Most of the previous code handles the error case and Promise case.

### Process results from the web worker

In [functions.js](functions.js), when a new web worker is created, it is provided a callback function to process the result. The callback function parses the data to determine the outcome of the job. It resolves or rejects the promise as determined by the job result data.

```JavaScript
        // create a new web worker
        const webWorker = new Worker("functions-worker.js");
        webWorker.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
            let data = event.data;
            if (typeof(data) == "string") {
                data = JSON.parse(data);
            }

            if (typeof(data.jobId) == "number") {
                const jobId = data.jobId;
                // get the promise info associated with the job id
                const promiseInfo = g_jobIdToPromiseInfoMap[jobId];
                if (promiseInfo) {
                    if (data.error) {
                        // The web worker returned an error
                        promiseInfo.reject(new Error());
                    }
                    else {
                        // The web worker returned a result
                        promiseInfo.resolve(data.result);
                    }
                    delete g_jobIdToPromiseInfoMap[jobId];
                }
            }
        });
```
